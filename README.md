# Credit-Risk-Analysis
Created a model which tells whether a person will be able to pay loan or not on basis of data. The dataset is from Kaggle.
Steps taken:
1. **EDA**: Done EDA on data, analyse the columns, missing values and imbalanced data. Explored their linear and non-linear relationships.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepared the data by handling missing values, outliers and imbalanced target column using SMOTE.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created new columns from previous ones to examine non-linear relationship and made easy for machine learning model to understand.
4. **Model Training**: Trained the XGBoost model and evaluate it using F1 score, classification report AUC ROC Curve.
